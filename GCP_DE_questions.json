Below is what is written in google cloud documnetation.If your application attempts to connect to the database and does not succeed, the database could be temporarily unavailable. In this case, sending too many simultaneous connection requests might waste additional database resources and increase the time needed to recover. Using exponential backoff prevents your application from sending an unresponsive number of connection requests when it can connect to the database.This retry only makes sense when first connecting, or when first grabbing a connection from the pool. If errors happen in the middle of a transaction, the application must do the retrying, and it must retry from the beginning of a transaction. So even if your pool is configured properly, the application might still see errors if connections are lost.Reference:https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/manage-connections#backoff",

The only supported export location is Cloud Storage. For information on saving query results, see Downloading and saving query results.You can export up to 1 GB of table data to a single file. If you are exporting more than 1 GB of data, use a wildcard to export the data into multiple files. When you export data to multiple files, the size of the files will vary.You cannot export nested and repeated data in CSV format. Nested and repeated data is supported for Avro and JSON exports.When you export data in JSON format, INT64 (integer) data types are encoded as JSON strings to preserve 64-bit precision when the data is read by other systems.You cannot export data from multiple tables in a single export job.You cannot choose a compression type other than GZIP when you export data using the Cloud Console or the classic BigQuery web UI.Reference:https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/exporting-data#export_limitations",

Develop a data pipeline where status updates are appended to BigQuery instead of updated.Using BigQuery as an OLTP store is considered an anti-pattern. Because OLTP stores have a high volume of updates and deletes, they are a mismatch for the data warehouse use case. To decide which storage option best fits your use case, review the Cloud storage products table.BigQuery is built for scale and can scale out as the size of the warehouse grows, so there is no need to delete older data. By keeping the entire history, you can deliver more insight on your business. If the storage cost is a concern, you can take advantage of BigQuery\\'s long term storage pricing by archiving older data and using it for special analysis when the need arises. If you still have good reasons for dropping older data, you can use BigQuery\\'s native support for date-partitioned tables and partition expiration. In other words, BigQuery can automatically delete older data.Reference:https://cloud.google.com/solutions/bigquery-data-warehouse#handling_change",

Use a larger instance type for your Cloud Dataflow workersWith autoscaling enabled, the Dataflow service does not allow user control of the exact number of worker instances allocated to your job. You might still cap the number of workers by specifying the --max_num_workers option when you run your pipeline. Here as per question CAP is 3, So we can change that CAP.For batch jobs, the default machine type is n1-standard-1. For streaming jobs, the default machine type for Streaming Engine-enabled jobs is n1-standard-2 and the default machine type for non-Streaming Engine jobs is n1-standard-4. When using the default machine types, the Dataflow service can therefore allocate up to 4000 cores per job. If you need more cores for your job, you can select a larger machine type.",
